## Overview
Welcome to the Fundamentals of Data Analysis repository! This repository covers essential concepts and techniques in data analysis, from joining datasets to plotting and data cleaning.

### Overview: Joining Datasets
Joining datasets is a crucial aspect of data analysis, allowing us to combine information from multiple sources. In this section, we explore basic and complex joins on datasets using Python libraries like Pandas. Through coding activities, you'll learn how to merge datasets based on common fields and perform multi-field joins efficiently.

### Overview: Plotting Datasets
Visualizing data is essential for gaining insights and communicating findings effectively. In this section, we cover various types of plots, including histograms, scatterplots, box plots, and joint plots. Through mini-lessons and coding activities, you'll learn how to create and customize plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Overview: Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a critical step in the data analysis process, ensuring that datasets are accurate, consistent, and reliable. In this section, we discuss common data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing data, eliminating duplicates, and filtering outliers. Through mini-lessons and coding activities, you'll learn essential techniques for cleaning and validating data effectively.

Embark on this exciting journey into the world of data analysis, and equip yourself with the skills and knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges with confidence!
